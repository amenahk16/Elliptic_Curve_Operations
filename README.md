# Elliptic_Curve_Operations
This code have been done for Applied Cryptography Course requirement 
In this program we aim to do all operation(Addition â€“ Multiplication) over defined field Zp in
which these field must be prime numbers in set of [11, 23, 37] (We might generalize later to accept any prime number). 

## Addition : this function aim to add two given point at curve
Brief steps explanation  :
(1) Check given field if in list or not, Note we can generalize it (check primality), but we follow specification
(2) if P1 = P2 =>  then preform doubling formula
(3) if x in given points are  P1.x = P2.x then its align vertically and the point in infinity
(4) otherwise preform addition formula

## Multiplication : is constructed from addition. 
Since the fact of the multiplication fact is if we have point name as P Then  Q= 5.P = P + P + P + P + P, So simple loop will work fine!
